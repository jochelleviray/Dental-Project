     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <p>My name is Regina Filange, and I have been practicing dentistry in the US for over 
       20 years. I earned my master degree in University of the Pacific located in San Francisco.
        I am a parent of two, and my facilty is children friendly. We are low-cost dental clinic because
       we want to help people as much as possible. There are other two dentists who run this clinic, Dr. Ross Filange 
       and Dr. Charlie Shrubb. Dr. Shrubb is a professor from the University of California, San Francisco. 
       She handles most of major treatment.</p>
